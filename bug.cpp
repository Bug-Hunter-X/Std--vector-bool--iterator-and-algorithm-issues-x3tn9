std::vector<bool> is not a standard container and has different behavior. It's specialized to save space, but it lacks the standard container interface. This leads to unexpected behavior when working with algorithms and iterators expecting standard container semantics.  For example, trying to use `std::find` with a `std::vector<bool>` might return unexpected results, or algorithms that assume contiguous memory might fail.
